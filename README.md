FIX-it: A Service Hiring Flutter Application

---------------------------------------------
📱 Overview:
---------------------------------------------
Fix-it is a role-based Flutter mobile application that connects Clients and Workers for various on-demand services. The app allows users to register as either a Client (service seeker) or a Worker (service provider), providing dedicated homepages and features for each role.

Clients can explore categories, browse through worker profiles, request services, track bookings, and communicate via chat. Workers can manage job requests, update their profiles, and maintain availability status.
